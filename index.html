  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <p>Born and raised in Ongata rongai though I have schooled across the country.
    I was born in the year 1993 February 10th as the last born in a family of 3 raised by a single parent(father).
    My passion for music started at an early stage but I officially started recording at the age of 19 that was in 2012.
    I derive my passion from life and the main fact that am shy as a person and music is the only way I can express myself.
    I mainly do hip-hop but I mostly consider myself as an artist or entertainer, hence I prefer the term rapper to hip-hop artist.
    I have worked on different genres of music and I believe in overstepping boundaries as long as my message reaches the
    targeted groups. All in all am an all rounded artist with much to offer. </p>
